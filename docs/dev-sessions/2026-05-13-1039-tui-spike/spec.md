# TUI Network Client — Spike

**Status:** Spec approved 2026-05-13. Implementation not started.
**Issue:** [#464](https://github.com/lmorchard/decafclaw/issues/464) (reframed from original "Ink TUI over JSON-RPC stdio")
**Type:** Prototype / spike. Throwaway-friendly until promoted.

## Context

Issue 464 was originally filed during a hermes-agent inspiration scan: hermes's TUI is an Ink (React-for-terminal, TypeScript) frontend that spawns its own Python backend over JSON-RPC stdio. We deprioritized it because `interactive_terminal.py` is sufficient for current use and the hermes model would duplicate session/tool/model state and conflict with the "one bot instance per token" Mattermost rule.

The reframing: build the Ink TUI as a **thin network client to the running decafclaw bot** over the existing WebSocket gateway — the same surface the web UI already drives. This sidesteps both problems:

- No competing bot instance — the TUI is a viewer/driver, not its own agent.
- No duplicate state — sessions, tools, model calls, confirmations, compaction all stay on the running daemon.
- No new transport — reuses `src/decafclaw/web/websocket.py` and the wire contracts in `src/decafclaw/web/message_types.json`.

Hermes remains a reference for terminal-UX patterns (composer behavior, prompt flows, markdown rendering) but **not** a template for the architecture. This is decafclaw-native: WebSocket + cookie auth + per-conversation event subscription, not stdio + JSON-RPC + spawned backend.

## Goals

A working spike that lets a developer:

1. Run `decafclaw-tui --token <t>` against `make dev` on localhost.
2. Pick or specify a conversation.
3. Send messages and watch streaming assistant responses.
4. See tool activity (`tool_call_start` / `tool_start` / `tool_status`) in an activity lane.
5. Approve or deny inline confirmation requests (shell commands, end-turn gates).
6. Hit `Ctrl+C` to cancel an in-flight turn or exit cleanly.

The bar for "spike validated": the TUI is good enough to drive a normal coding-assistance turn end-to-end without falling back to the web UI.

## Non-goals (Phase 2 candidates)

These are **explicitly deferred from the spike**, not rejected. If the spike validates the idea, several of these are likely first follow-ups — captured here so we don't re-derive them.

| Deferred item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Markdown rendering of assistant text | Hermes has a small Markdown-to-Ink renderer. Likely first Phase 2 add — plain text gets old fast. |
| Multi-line composer / queued input | Hermes-style queue while agent is busy, `\` + Enter newline, Shift+Enter, `$EDITOR` integration. |
| Input history (persistent) | `~/.decafclaw/tui_history` or similar. |
| Tab completion | Slash commands, `@[[Page]]` mentions, file paths. |
| Theme/skin support | Match decafclaw's web UI theme tokens if we promote. |
| Canvas panel mirror | Render a `canvas_update` view in a side pane. |
| Files / vault sidebars | Browse and open via REST + WS. |
| Notification inbox | Bell push over WS already exists; surface it in a status line. |
| Widget inputs | `widget_input` flow — needed for skills that emit widgets. |
| Scrollback past current session | Currently relies on terminal scrollback; would need internal pager. |
| Mouse support | Stock Ink supports it; we're just not wiring it. |
| OSC52 clipboard copy | Convenient for grabbing assistant output. |
| Conversation folders / move/rename | REST endpoints exist; not part of the chat surface. |
| Model picker UI | `set_model` wire message exists; spike just uses whatever's active. |
| Reflection / context inspector views | Diagnostic surfaces in the web UI; not core to chat. |
| Windows support | Mac/Linux only for the spike. |

If the spike succeeds, the natural Phase 2 sequence is roughly: **markdown rendering → multi-line composer + history → tab completion → theme → model picker**, with widgets/canvas/files/vault later if there's appetite.

```

- Network boundary: `ws://<host>:<port>/api/ws` with `Cookie: decafclaw_session=<token>` on upgrade.
- Conversation selection: REST `GET /api/conversations` for the picker; WS `select_conv` to subscribe.
- No bot-side changes. The TUI is a pure client.

## Components

```
tui/
  package.json          # ink, ink-text-input, react, ws, tsx, typescript
  tsconfig.json
  README.md
  src/
    entry.tsx           # TTY gate, argv/env parsing, auth resolution, render <App/>
    App.tsx             # Ink tree: transcript + activity + composer + confirm prompt
    wsClient.ts         # connect, send, onMessage, reconnect w/ backoff, close
    types.ts            # hand-typed WS message discriminated union (codegen-shaped)
    conversationPicker.tsx  # initial list/create picker when --conv is absent
```

Five files. The spike's structural budget is "everything lives in one of these five." When a file needs to split, it's a signal to revisit Option B (layered structure, codegen).

### File responsibilities

- **`entry.tsx`** — TTY check, argv parsing (`--token` / `--conv` / `--host`), env fallback (`DECAFCLAW_TOKEN`, `DECAFCLAW_HOST`), construct `WSClient`, render `<App/>`. Exits early on missing token or non-TTY stdin.
- **`wsClient.ts`** — Owns the socket. Exposes `connect()`, `send(msg)`, `on(handler)`, `close()`. Reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, … cap 30s). Surfaces `reconnected` events to the dispatcher so the UI can mark `[reconnected]` and re-issue `select_conv`.
- **`types.ts`** — One TS type per wire message, keyed on `type` field. Exports `WSMessage` discriminated union. Field names match `src/decafclaw/web/message_types.json` verbatim. Includes both directions; client→server types are used by `wsClient.send()` callers, server→client by the dispatcher.
- **`App.tsx`** — React `useState` for: transcript array, in-flight assistant draft text, activity-lane state (current tool name/status), confirm-prompt state (request_id + payload), connection state. Single `dispatch(msg: WSMessage)` reducer-style function with an exhaustive `switch` (TS `never` guard on default). Composer is a stock `ink-text-input`. Confirm prompt suspends the composer and accepts `y` / `n` / `a` (always).
- **`conversationPicker.tsx`** — Hits `/api/conversations` via `fetch` (Node 18+ has it), shows up to N recent conversations, lets user pick or trigger "new conversation" (server creates lazily on first `user_message` to a fresh `conv_id`, so picker just generates one).

## Data flow

1. `entry.tsx` resolves token → constructs `WSClient({host, token})` → renders `<App/>`.
2. `WSClient` opens `/api/ws` with `Cookie: decafclaw_session=<token>` header. On open, emits `ready` to dispatcher.
3. If `--conv <id>` provided: dispatcher sends `select_conv` immediately. Otherwise: render `<ConversationPicker/>`, fetch list via REST, on selection send `select_conv`.
4. Server responds with `conv_selected` (+ initial state) and `conv_history` (recent messages). Dispatcher populates transcript.
5. **Message handling** (server → client):
   - `chunk` → append to in-flight assistant draft.
   - `message_complete` → finalize draft into transcript, clear draft.
   - `tool_call_start` / `tool_start` / `tool_status` → update activity-lane state.
   - `tool_end` (if surfaced; otherwise next `chunk` clears it) → clear activity lane.
   - `confirm_request` → set confirm-prompt state, suspend composer.
   - `compaction_done` → show `[compaction complete]` line; optionally reload history.
   - `model_changed` → show `[model: …]` line.
   - `error` → push error line.
   - Unknown `type` → log to stderr, ignore. (Forward-compat.)
6. **Message handling** (client → server):
   - Composer submit → `{type: "user_message", conv_id, text, attachments: []}`.
   - Confirm `y` → `{type: "confirmation_response", conv_id, request_id, decision: "approve", extras: {}}`. `n` → `"deny"`. `a` → `"always"`.
   - `Ctrl+C` while turn is in flight → `{type: "cancel_turn", conv_id}`. While idle → close WS cleanly, exit.

## Error handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Missing token (no flag, no env) | Print error, exit 1. |
| WS upgrade rejected (401/403) | Print "auth failed" + URL, exit 1. |
| WS dropped mid-session | Reconnect with backoff. On success: re-`select_conv`, request fresh `conv_history`, mark `[reconnected]` in transcript. |
| Malformed JSON line | Log to stderr (above the Ink frame), ignore. |
| Unknown wire `type` | Log to stderr, ignore. Don't crash on protocol additions. |
| Non-TTY stdin | Exit early with a message — same gate hermes uses. |
| `Ctrl+C` while WS busy | Send `cancel_turn`. Press again to exit. |

No retry loops with hidden state, no silent fallbacks. If something keeps failing, the user sees it on stderr above the UI.

## Testing

- **Vitest unit test** for the dispatcher: feed sample WS messages → assert state transitions. Pure-function reducer is the only thing worth testing in a spike.
- **Manual smoke**:
  - Run `make dev` (already running per Les's workflow) and `cd tui && npm run dev` in another shell.
  - Send a message → see streaming chunks → see `message_complete`.
  - Trigger `run_shell_command` via the agent → see `confirm_request` → approve → see tool output.
  - Force a compaction → see `compaction_done` line.
  - Drop the WS (kill `make dev`, restart) → see reconnect + `[reconnected]` marker.
- **No Ink rendering tests, no end-to-end tests.** Promoting the spike includes adding those.

## Promotion path (A → B, no rework)

The spike is Option A (hand-typed minimal Ink). The successor is Option B (codegen from `message_types.json`, optionally split into layered directories). The discipline that makes A→B free:

1. **`types.ts` is shaped exactly like codegen output would be.** One type alias per message, field names matching `message_types.json` verbatim, `WSMessage` discriminated union exported. When we promote: write `tui/scripts/gen-types.ts`, extend `make gen-message-types` to also emit `tui/src/types.generated.ts`, `git mv` the hand-written file out. Zero consumer churn.
2. **Dispatcher switch is exhaustive against `WSMessage["type"]`.** TS `never` guard on default. A new wire type added in `message_types.json` becomes a compile error in the TUI rather than silent drift.
3. **No reaching into message internals from `wsClient.ts`.** It's a dumb pipe — `send(msg)` and `on(handler)`. State decisions live in `App.tsx`. This means splitting `App.tsx` later doesn't require restructuring the transport.

If the spike grows past five files organically, that's the trigger to split — not premature.

## Acceptance criteria

The spike is "validated" when all of the following work against a locally running `make dev`:

- [ ] Connect with `--token <t>` and either pick a conversation or pass `--conv <id>`.
- [ ] Send a user message, see streamed assistant response, see `message_complete` finalize it.
- [ ] Trigger a confirm-gated tool (shell command), approve inline, see tool output continue.
- [ ] Trigger a confirm-gated tool, deny inline, see the agent recover.
- [ ] `Ctrl+C` mid-turn cancels via `cancel_turn`; transcript reflects the cancel.
- [ ] Kill `make dev`, restart, see TUI reconnect and resume the same conversation.
- [ ] Run `cd tui && npm test` — dispatcher unit test passes.
- [ ] Run `cd tui && npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.

## Open questions

None at spec time. Items that may surface during implementation:

- Whether `tool_end` is currently emitted to the WS (not in the message_types.json grep). If not, activity-lane clear-on-next-`chunk` heuristic stands.
- Whether `/api/conversations` returns a shape the picker can use directly, or we need a different REST endpoint for the listing.

Both are implementation-time verifications, not blockers.
